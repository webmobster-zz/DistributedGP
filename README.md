# DistributedGP
An experimental attempt to create a distributed GP system

This is very much a work in progress and while arguablly usable I wouldn't recommend using it for any reason as its underlying design is still not finalized.

Licenced under GPL v2 (for now?), with some code stolen from the rust threadpool library (advice needed on how to properly give credit and licence that source file).
